2)  Android KTX
	- It is a collection of kotlin extensions using which devs can decrease the lines of code.
	- Many of the jetpack libraries are linked with various Android KTX modules. 
	
3) Multi-dex
	-While making any real-life mobile application, the count of methods in project libraries can easily cross the number 65,536.
	  In this situation, developers take the help of Multidex library which performs the system split of the .dex file of the application into multiple .dex files.
