It is the library that allows us to bind UI components from ur Layouts to Data sources in the app using
a declarative format rather than programmatically.

Views are bind to data source is called dataBinding. (used in MVVM pattern)

binding can be done easily but the views can be accessed directly by their ID
		OR
u can access the view by declaring a variable and Data class (basically a data source).
