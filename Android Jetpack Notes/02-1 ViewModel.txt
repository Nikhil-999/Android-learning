ViewModel is a class that is responsible for preparing and managing the data for an Activity or a Fragment.

Its main function is to maintain the integrity and allows data to service during configuration changes like screen rotations. 

Instead of storing the UI data into the activity we should use viewModel to store, and will survive the configuration changes (like rotate screen).

Advantages of ViewModel Component:

Helps in data management during configuration changes
Reduce UI bugs and crashes
Best practice for software design
