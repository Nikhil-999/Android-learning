Fragments can be used to make custom : action bar , Dialog boxes , Recycle View and tab modes

reason being Fragment gives a body structure inside which all above Views can be implemented.

Two aspects of Fragments:	
	Fragment manager and Fragment Transaction

# Fragment Manager:		## Fragments usually gets replaced hence to keep track (Reference) of each fragment we have fragment manager.
	-> Every Activity has its own fragment manager.
	-> It maintains the references to all the fragments inside the activity.
	-> We can use findFragmentById() method to get a reference to a particular fragment inside the activity.

# Fragment Transaction: 
	-> The act of adding, removing, replacing fragment into the activity are considered as Transaction.
	-> Reference variable to transaction can be created like
		-: FragmentTransaction demo = getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction();
