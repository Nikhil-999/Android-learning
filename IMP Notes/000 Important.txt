Context --> The current state of the application/Object is called context.	 
	    It lets newly-created objects understand what has been going on. 
	Typically, you call it to get information regarding another part of your program (activity and package/application)


Companion object --> it works like Static modifier such that methods or variable defined inside companion object can be accessed directly by class name.


**To do some task asynchronously we use Coroutines hence whenever we declare our own functions we use "suspend" keyword so that
	it can be called inside a coroutine.

**The "lazy" keyword is used when we need some line of code to be executed only and only when that particular variable is called.
