A service can run continuously in the background even if the application is closed or the user switches to another application. 

Service is an android component that performs a long-running operation about which the user might not be aware of as it does not have UI.

Types of Service :	
			Foreground Services	-- User can interact (Stays alive even if the app is terminated.)(Like notifications)
			
			Background Services	-- User can't interact	(will terminate if the app is terminated)
			
			Bound Services		-- A component of the app is linked with the service. Bound services perform their task 
							as long as any application component is bound to it. 
						 	More than one component is allowed to bind themselves with a service at a time. 
							In order to bind an application component with a service bindService() method is used. 

Life cycle of Service:	Services have 2 possible paths to complete its life cycle namely Started and Bounded. 	


Common example of Services is : Like downloading a file in background, etc.
