Gradle is the build toolkit for ultimately build your app.

Gradle is responsible for converting your java/kotlin files AND .xml *(basically all source files)* into .class file 
and then those .class files are converted into .dex file (Also known as Dalvik Bytecode) 
and groups them all into one compressed file --> APK

This build system uses some conventions: an example of one is to specify the directory containing the source files (in Eclipse it is \src folder)
or resources files (in Eclipse it is \res folder).
Now, in order to automate all these tasks, there has to be a script, we can write your own build system using 
shell scripting in Linux or batch files syntax in Windows. 


Grade is a JVM-based build system. That means you can write your own script in Java, which Android Studio makes use of.



	Debug and release APKs

Debug APK is the one which can be found inside app/build/...app.APK
and generally used to install app in mobiles/tablet/etc.

but u have to create "release APK" using "Build" in the navigation bar, 
which later can be used to host your app in app store by providing Release APK globally.
