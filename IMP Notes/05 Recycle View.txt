TO use recyclerView, must include dependency in the grade file.


	RecycleView is a main class 

ViewHolder :- Each individual element in the list is defined by a view holder object.
Adapter	:- The RecyclerView requests those views, and binds the views to their data, by calling methods in the adapter. 
		You define the adapter by extending RecyclerView.Adapter.





			      ------ ViewHolder ----

layoutManager	->	RecycleView	<-	Adapter


Also, layoutInflater is used to bind the XML to a single view and then we pass it to MyViewHolder Class for further process.
